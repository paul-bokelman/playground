# The playground

This repo is a messy collection of all things from utility functions/algorithms and random tests to math helpers to avoid laborious calculations. I am always updating the content in this "project" so I figured I'd throw it on GitHub.

<sub>With some wishful thinking, i'll document this repo ;)</sub>
